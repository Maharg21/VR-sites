WIP!!! 

I'm still getting used to how things work with A-frame. Right now, I'm still figuring out why some geometry is behaving the way it is at the moment (such as one of the cylinders appearing horizontal for some reason).
Not an ambitious project in the slightest. My vision at the moment is you're in a large castle chamber and you walk to a pedestal with a floating orb that you can either touch or pick up. 
I still want to add more pillars, add walls across the edges of the planes, perhaps a bit of lighting if things go well. 

Created and tested in Glitch. Here's the glitch link (assuming it'll work) https://fire-dog-soy.glitch.me
